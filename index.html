                        I am writing this paper according to my own work experience. I started working when I was 13 years old. I worked at a kids clothing store in the mall after school and on the weekends. I started working at an early age because my family needed the money. My mother raised five children on her own by holding two jobs, so we all had to help. I would go to school full time and work part-time. I feel that I know the value of money due to my work experiences. Once I start working, it was really hard to stop or cut back on the income that I was earning. I've always wanted to go back to college to get my degree, but I was not able to because I didn't want to make less money. I tried going to school part-time and working full time, but I was not able to do both. I think that if I had the opportunity to get an education first, I would do so before trying to earn a living, but in my situation, I had to work. On the other hand, I think it was good to have had the experience because it made me more discipline.</p>

                        I started working due to necessity, but I think along the way luxury became my necessity. I feel that no matter how much I make, it was not enough because there is always something else I need to have. I believe it is about the lifestyle I chose to live which is influenced by the society we live in. I work hard now because it is for my children. I want to provide them with what I did not have growing up. I want to make sure that they have nothing to worry about except to finish school and get a good job. I did not have the same opportunity so I feel that it is very important for me to provide them with the education they need. Most jobs require a degree in order to move up in the company. All the work experience that I had did not get me what I wanted at my company because of politics and other reasons. This is the other reason why I am back in school. Education and experience are what most companies are seeking for anyone they hire.</p>
